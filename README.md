## TextHackventure!
This is a game made for [Hack Club's Siege contest](https://siege.hackclub.com). It was my first time coding in Go, thus I sometimes used AI to help me understand new concepts (mainly maps, which are extensively used in this project). I also used sites like [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/go/) or [GoByExample](https://gobyexample.com/) to learn more.

## Controls
The commands ingame are pretty straightforward and intuitive, but you can see the full list with ```help```, which gives the following menu : 
```goang
> help
You entered the command: help
command list :
help - display this help menu
look - look around the place you are currently in, if given no argument. If given an argument,  look at your iventory, item or feature in the room.
go [north/south/east/west] - go in the choosed direction
read [note/sign] - read an element of the place
take [item] - take an item by it's name.
inventory - list the inventory you have.
talk [person] - talk to the specified person, ex hermit
```

Hints are given inside the describe of each places, so be aware of this if you're stuck :wink:
